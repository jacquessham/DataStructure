# Recursion (Java)
Recursion is able to solve for problems where it depends on smaller instance of the same problem, such as Factorial or Fibonacci series.

## Classic Examples
### Factorial
The formula of factorial is <i>n! = n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)...2\*1</i> where <i>n > 0</i>. There is an interface of <i>Factorial</i> for the calculation. You may utilize either <i>FactorialRecursive.java</i> or <i>FactorialIterative.java</i> to make the calculation. The script does not ensure the input is a non-negative number, please do not pass a negative number.

### Fibonacci Series
The formula of Fibonacci Series is <i>F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub></i>. There is an interface of <i>Factorial</i> for the calculation. You may utilize either <i>FibonacciRecursive.java</i> or <i>FibonacciIterative.java</i> to make the calculation. The script does not ensure the input is a non-negative number, please do not pass a negative number.
