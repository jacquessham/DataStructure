# Sorting Algorithm

There are 5 algorithms in this folder:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Selection Sort
<br><br>

## Files
There are 6 files in this folder. Each algorithm has its own Python file. Additionally, there is a file of SortingDriver.py to call each algorithm and time the run time for each algorithm.

## Algorithms

### Selection Sort
Worst time: O(n^2)

### Bubble Sort
Worst time: O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort
Worst time: O(n^2)

### Merge Sort
Worst time: O(n log n)

### Quick Sort
Worst time: O(n^2)
