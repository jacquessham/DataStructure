# Graph

## Files
### Graph.(py/rb)
Create a Graph object and allows you to do Topological Sort and Dijkstra's Algorithm.

### AcyclicalGraphDriver.(py/rb)
Drive script to demo how to do Topological Sort in an acyclic Graph. An acyclic Graph means a graph with no graph cycle. It uses the data from <i>SimpleAcylicalGraphData.csv</i> which describes a tyical schedules of Computer Science classes.
<br><br>
\*\*Note: Ruby script is coming soon...

### GraphDriver.(py/rb)
Driver script to demo how to sort Graph with Dijkstra's Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the short route to go among all nodes. It uses the data from <i>SimpleGraphData.csv</i> which is an airline schedule with fares.
<br><br>
\*\*Note: Ruby script is coming soon...

### GraphDistanceDriver.(py/rb)
Same as GraphDriver.(py/rb), except it uses the from <i>GraphData.csv</i> with more destinations.
<br><br>
\*\*Note: Ruby script is coming soon...
